        "This section will detail the implementation of the simulator. This simulator is implemented using three classes, Events, Stations, and Riders. Station and Rider objects will each hold data corresponding to bike stations and bike riders, respectively. Event objects will hold data corresponding to either an arrival of a rider at a station or the return of a rider to a station. Once at a station, a rider will either take or return a bike, or enter the correpsonding queue if necessary. A rider will need to enter a queue at a station if the station either does not have enough bikes for the rider that is arriving, or if it is at capacity when a rider returns. For this simulator, there will be m stations and n riders. the arrival times of riders will be given by an exponential distribution with mean rate $\\lambda$. A rider will select station i to initially go to with probability $p_i$, and will return to station j with probability $q_{i,j}$ The duration of a rider's use of the bike will be generated using a log-normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$."
